Fairly recently, I began to utilize my Macbook Pro for creating modern SPAs. This wasn't any old MacBook, however. It was a Mid-2012 MacBook Pro. Are you wonderig if my computer would keep up with the modern web development workflow?

I would be wondering that too. But I only started to beg the question after my satisfaction with my Microsoft Surface Pro 5 decreased. Don't get me wrong, it is a device that has exceeded my expectations; the only thing is - I was running the Windows operating system. It's not that I hate Windows 10 - it's *alright*, but it began to feel bloated.

I felt more and more bloated as I begrugingly used grahpical install wizards, as apps polluted *My* documents folder, and as I continued to type the backslash key when traversig directories.

Installing Docker was the cherry on top. Unlike on Linux-based distributions, I had to install virtualbox and spin up a vm just run a container. And, I did not want to opt in using a buggy Windows insiders build so I can have the priviledge of running a buggy build of the Linux kernel made to run alongside the buggy Windows kernel.

Enough was enough, and I transfered all my files to my MacBook. My MacBook Pro from Mid-2012 is still a powerhouse, even in 2019. It sports a slick Gigabit Ethernet port, a *blazing fast* FireWire 800 port, along with two USB 3.0 ports, an SD card reader, a fricking DVD drive, and an anti-theft lock mechanism. Did I mention that it had a headphone jack? Chances are, your MacBook ain't got one. But mine does :smirk:
