TODO: workshop this into a post in which i describe non-programming things that I want to learn. summer went by so fast, and i didn't get a change to execute the plan in the previous form of this draft

Last summer I learned something totally foreign and new. I learned what frontend web developers do (for the most part). With some Java experience, I jumped into building frontend single page applications with the JavaScript framework Vue. I had to manually setup my tooling environment, creating Webpack, Babel, PostCSS, and other configuration files. It felt great taking strides learning something from the ground up. I wanted to repeat the process and learn something else new.

But what should I learn? I need something that I have little to no experience doing. But this time, I want to learn something that will be significantly easier learning *now*, rather than years down the line. At younger ages, brain elasticity and fluidity is maximized and slowly declines over time. Only now can I leverage the brain's elasticity. Every ticking second means wasted opportunity that I may not be able to get back (if enough time passes).

Naturally, learning a second language fits the aforementioned prerequisites. It's something that's extremely difficult the first time around. Learning the third or fourth language is significantly less difficult than the second because the brain has already been "optimized" for thinking in extra languages. Choosing a language, I dithered between German, Korean, and French.

However, there is something else that I've been very motivated to learn: Blender. Blender is a software that facilitates the creation and animation 3D models and scenes. I've always wanted to recreate the animations I have imagined in my daydreams into something more tangible. Although this does not completely fit the learning criteria I just laid out, it is something I've always wanted to do.

I think it would be highly beneficial to write out my learning process - so I can directly refernece it. During and after executing, I can refer back to this chart if I feel like I'm inefficient, or I think I should modify my learning approach. This means I'll write down even the more obvious learning techniques; I think being conscoius of them really helps the learning process.

## Technique

I hope to minimize unnecessary difficulty by preparing my learning techniques beforehand.

I intend to optimize the following steps

1. Brain preparation
2. Learning Material
3. Memorization / Recall Technique

### Brain Preparation

By preparing, I intend to prepare to connect current knowledge with future (potential) knowledge. Not just connecting English words with German words, but also phrases, sentences, and grammaticasl differences / inconsistencies. Really learning English would help, like knowing what categories words belong in, what tenses words are in, or what kind of combinations are possible with words. For example, I'd like to know what a 'present participle verb' is, understand how it works with adjacent words, and know relations with present participle verbs with other words. That way, when I come across similar concepts in other languages, I'll understand the structures I'm dealing with. Writing down some kind of mine map is a requirement.

I used to believe that learning a foreign language helps you learn your native language. Typically it does, but I think that might be a more inefficient or misguided approach. It may be easier to learn a foreign language when you already know the language constructs in your native language.

### Learning Material

Kind of like computer neural networks, if you feed your brain crap, you'll memorize (and recall) crap. I think this means more than using the *correct* material. The material must be structured. Sites like StackOverflow have little structure because you're given a single answer with minimal context. Other sites like freeCodingCamp directly contrast this, since content is separated into various modules and sections. If you already have a structure, then StackOverflow is more beneficial, because you know where to place knowledge in relation to other bits of knowledge (that are closely, or even sparsely related).

### Memorization / Recall Technique

With sufficient brain preparation and high quality learning material, I won't learning anything if I can't memorize properly.

I'll employ the following techniques

- Imagine structuers (overall and direct)
- Frequently attempt recall of just-read words
