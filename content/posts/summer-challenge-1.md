Last summer I learned something totally foreign and new. I learned how to become a website developer. With some Java experience, I jumped into building frontend single page applications with the JavaScript framework Vue. I used a combination of Webpack, Babel, PostCSS, and other related tooling to accomplish this. It felt great learning huge amounts about something new from the ground up and I wanted to repeat the process.

Like last summer, I want to learn totally foreign and new. New skills that I'll use in the future. But this time, I want to learn something that will be significantly easier learning *now*, rather than years down the line. At younger ages, brain elasticity and fluidity is maximized and slowly declines over time. I want to leverage this brain mechanic as soon as possible.

Naturally, I realized learning a second language fits the aforementioned prerequisites. It's something that's extremely difficult the first time around. Learning the third or fourth language is significantly less difficult than the second because the brain has already been "optimized" for thinking in extra languages.

So I realized that I need to choose some language to learn. I didn't want to learn Spanish. Spanish would be too familiar for my liking, since I already took some Spanish classes. German, Vietnamese, and Korean were also primary candidates. After thinking about it for a while, I finally decided on German.

I'll need to maximize my efficiency. I've laid out some of my plans below. Even though my plans may be obvious, I'll write them down anyways - I've learned that consciously thinking about learning techniques really helps.

## Technique

I hope to minimize unnecessary difficulty by preparing my learning techniques beforehand.

I intend to optimize the following steps

1. Brain preparation
2. Learning Material
3. Memorization / Recall Technique

### Brain Preparation

By preparing, I intend to prepare to connect current knowledge with future (potential) knowledge. Not just connecting English words with German words, but also phrases, sentences, and grammaticasl differences / inconsistencies. Really learning English would help, like knowing what categories words belong in, what tenses words are in, or what kind of combinations are possible with words. For example, I'd like to know what a 'present participle verb' is, understand how it works with adjacent words, and know relations with present participle verbs with other words. That way, when I come across similar concepts in other languages, I'll understand the structures I'm dealing with. Writing down some kind of mine map is a requirement.

I used to believe that learning a foreign language helps you learn your native language. Typically it does, but I think that might be a more inefficient or misguided approach. It may be easier to learn a foreign language when you already know the language constructs in your native language.

### Learning Material

Kind of like computer neural networks, if you feed your brain crap, you'll memorize (and recall) crap. I think this means more than using the *correct* material. The material must be structured. Sites like StackOverflow have little structure because you're given a single answer with minimal context. Other sites like freeCodingCamp directly contrast this, since content is separated into various modules and sections.

I also would like to consciously get information from multiple sources. Not just to complement my main source, but to treat is as a main source.

### Memorization / Recall Technique

With sufficient brain preparation and high quality learning material, I won't learning anything if I can't memorize properly.

I'll employ the following techniques

- Imagine structuers (overall and direct)
- Frequently attempt recall of just-read words

It may be better to learn variations of the present tense, rather than the present tense, the past tense, the future tense (the traditional method)
