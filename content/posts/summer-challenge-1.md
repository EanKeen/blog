Most people know that exercising the same parts of the brain or doing the same thing over and over again can lead to burnout, especially if that thought pattern or activity is frequently partaken in. Ever since the first few weeks after I got into coding until now, I've been teetering on the edge of burnout, constantly pushing myself to, at, or over that line. At first, it was the act of *working* at code too often. As it turns out, coding ~18 hours a day is *not* healthy for months on end. So I had to stop that. But a year or so after that, now it feels like I am *thinking* about code too frequently. As it turns out, listening to coding podcasts, reading programming articles, and the act of programing for most of the day isn't healthy either. I think it would be a good idea to identify and pursue some activities besides programming.

Something most people want to do is learn a new language. I do as well. It's something that's extremely difficult the first time around, but gets easier after being knowledgeable in a few other foreign language because the brain has already been "optimized" for thinking in extra languages. My top languages German, Korean, and French.

But, the parts of the brain that I use when learning a language feel overused. I want to learn something more orthogonal to that, like learning how to use a 3D modeling and animation software. I've always wanted to recreate the animations I have imagined into something more tangible. Naturally, I'll have to choose some software to 3D model with. I do admit, I have experience using Autodesk Maya, SideFX's Houdini, and Blender. Although I could not possibly rationalize a decision with my limited perspective, I chose Blender over Houdini. Maya was out of the picture - it's too expensive and bloated. I loved the node-based aspect of Houdini, but there seemed to be many more learning resources about Blender.

Besides learning a language and 3D modeling / animating, I've also wanted to learn how to play good chess. As in, understanding the game mechanics deeply. I do play some games from time to time, but I want my skill level to increase. (right now my low rating is ~1600 on [lichess](https://lichess.org) for Bullet/Blitz/Correspondence and ~1900 for puzzles). It would be my goal to play above a 2000 level.

However, my desire to improve my chess skill is much lower than my desire to figure out 3D modeling and animating.
