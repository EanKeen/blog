I'm Edwin Kofler, an aspiring web developer.

My most current project is an interactive periodic table. The most recent public version is [here](https://eankeen.github.io/periodic-table/), which is a few months outdated. (I can't deploy the more recent versions because they have a back-end). I hope to deploy the complete site before November. 

Check out my GitHub [here](https://github.com/EanKeen).
