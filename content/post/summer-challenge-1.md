Last summer I learned something totally foreign and new. I learned how to become a website developer. With some Java experience, I jumped into building frontend single page applications with the JavaScript framework Vue. I used a combination of Webpack, Babel, PostCSS, and other related tooling to accomplish this. I learned a monstrous amount of skills required for JavaScript development. But in actually, that's not a lot. I barely scratched the surface in things that I had to be proficient in.

Like last summer, I want to learn totally foreign and new. I want to learn some new skills that I'll use in the future. But this time, I want to learn something that will be significantly easier learning *now*, rather than years down the line. At younger ages, brain elasticity and fluidity is maximized and slowly declines over time. I must leverage this particular mechanic of my brain before its too late.

Naturally, I realized learning a language fits the aforementioned prerequisites. Like last year, I want to learn a ton, but it will still account for barely anything in the grand scheme of things. I learned Spanish in a classroom-like environment during the first few years of High School. I don't want to go back to that language because it'll be too familiar. Something that I have an insubstantial knowledge of. I had a few languages in mind: German, Vietnamese, or Korean.

What if I learned two languages this summer?

We know that learning an extra language requires significant remapping of neural connections in brain tissues. The first extra language does a lot of the remapping. This may be why learning an extra language is so difficult. But after consecutive languages, learning difficulty significantly decreases. Because I probably won't be performing this challenge in the future, it may be easier to learn 2 rather than 1. This would set up my brain structure for learning extra languages down the road.

## Technique

Of course, I wouldn't jump straight into learning two languages without planning beforehand. Significant preparation needs to be made so unnecessary difficulty is reduced. For example, we know that learning two languages that are too similar is a terrible idea. So I must either learn German and Vietnamese or German and Korean.

I found at least 3 things that I need to optimize.

1. Brain preparation
2. Learning Material
3. Memorization / Recall Technique

### Brain Preparation

I need to get ready to current my brain's current knowledge with the knowledge I'm about to learn. If there's no connection, then it would be harder to find that material. More connections may imply there are more ways to access that information. What are we connecting? One or more foreign languages with English. Do I know English? Not really. I can think it, speak it, and write it, but I don't understand it. I wouldn't be able to tell you with absolute certainty what categories words belong in, what tenses words are in, or what kind of combinations are possible with words. This is really important! Let's use a 'present participle verb' for example. Before I even start learning another language, I want to know what it is, how it works with adjacent words, and how it relates to similar grammar ideals. That way, when I come across the German or Korean (if one even exists) variants, I know exactly where it fits within the language - and understand what kind of structures I can use it in. Writing down some kind of mine map is a requirement.

I used to believe that learning a foreign language helps you learn your native language. Typically it does, but I think that might be a more inefficient or misguided approach. It may be easier to learn a foreign language when you already have those English connections - that are ready to connect.

### Learning Material

Kind of like computer neural networks, if you feed your brain crap, you'll memorize (and recall) crap. This goes further than just using the *correct* material. Preferably, the material has a structure that can follow for each stage of learning. Sites like StackOverflow are the exact opposite. Your information comes from a single page. There are absolutely no connections to similar materials. That's why it can be hard to memorize programming stuff if you only use StackOverflow for learning. We're looking for something like a book, where there are distinct chapters and sections, each representing a meaningful chunk of subject material. Also, our knowledge will be able to stick better if we use multiple sources. In regular classes, you're not only using your textbook, but also your notes, online videos, forum posts, or other blogs to digest information. We need to be able to find a variety of sources that past the aforementioned criteria, and that compliment  each other.

### Memorization / Recall Technique

With sufficient brain preparation and high quality learning material, you won't learn anything if you don't know how to memorize properly. For starters, we'll need to imagine the structure of the English language (that we developed from [brain preparation](###Brains Preparation)). Once we know how the concept we're about to learn fits in, we can start memorizing it. It's important that we used spaces repetition techniques to accomplish this. I'm not exactly sure I'll do this, but I'll have to think of something.

Usually languages are learned by first learning the present tense, the past tense, the future tense, etc. I think I might want to do it differently. Once I create a map of the kind of grammatical structures in English language, I'll learn whatever structures share the same verb tense. That way, I can learn something new while still periodically recalling the same verb sense. That may be variations of the present tense - but if there is no difference then it might be better to learn past tense. It could be that learning variations of (ex. present, past) tense is too difficult because the learner would have to understand the functionality of conjunctions etc. other stuff (which may be too complicated).
