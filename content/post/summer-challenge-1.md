Last summer I learned something totally foreign and new. I learned how to become a website developer. With some Java experience, I jumped into building frontend single page applications with the JavaScript framework Vue. I used a combination of Webpack, Babel, PostCSS, and other related tooling to accomplish this. It felt great learning huge amounts about something new from the ground up and I wanted to repeat the process.

Like last summer, I want to learn totally foreign and new. New skills that I'll use in the future. But this time, I want to learn something that will be significantly easier learning *now*, rather than years down the line. At younger ages, brain elasticity and fluidity is maximized and slowly declines over time. I want to leverage this brain mechanic as soon as possible.

Naturally, I realized learning a second language fits the aforementioned prerequisites. It's something that's extremely difficult the first time around. Learning the third or fourth language is significantly less difficult than the second because the brain has already been "optimized" for thinking in extra languages.

So I realized that I need to choose some language to learn. I didn't want to learn Spanish. Spanish would be too familiar for my liking, since I already took some Spanish classes. German, Vietnamese, and Korean were also primary candidates. After thinking about it for a while, I finally decided on German. But, how would that compare to learning German in addition to another language?

If you think about it, it might be wise learning two languages (strategically). Learning the languages concurrently, or at least back to back would set my brain up to learn additional language in the future, as previously mentioned. I'll benefit most if I don't plan to learn more languages soon after this challenge.

Whether I learn one or two languages, I'll want to maximize my efficiency. I've laid out some of my plans below. Even though my plans may be obvious, I'll write them down anyways - I've learned that consciously thinking about learning techniques really helps.

## Technique

I hope to minimize unnecessary difficulty by preparing my learning techniques beforehand.

I intend to optimize the following steps

1. Brain preparation
2. Learning Material
3. Memorization / Recall Technique

### Brain Preparation

By preparing, I intend to prepare to connect current knowledge with future (potential) knowledge. Not just connecting English words with German words, but also phrases, sentences, and grammaticasl differences / inconsistencies. Really learning English would help, like knowing what categories words belong in, what tenses words are in, or what kind of combinations are possible with words. For example, I'd like to know what a 'present participle verb' is, understand how it works with adjacent words, and know relations with present participle verbs with other words. That way, when I come across similar concepts in other languages, I'll understand the structures I'm dealing with. Writing down some kind of mine map is a requirement.

I used to believe that learning a foreign language helps you learn your native language. Typically it does, but I think that might be a more inefficient or misguided approach. It may be easier to learn a foreign language when you already know the language constructs in your native language.

### Learning Material

Kind of like computer neural networks, if you feed your brain crap, you'll memorize (and recall) crap. I think this means more than using the *correct* material. The material must have some structure. Sites like StackOverflow have no structure because you're given a single answer with minimal context. However, sites of materials with meaningful and distinct chunk of subject material are perfect. Like things with chapters or sections.
Getting knowledge from multiple sources also helps. In regular classes, you're not only using your textbook, but also your notes, online videos, forum posts, or other blogs to digest information. It's important that the sources complement by eachother.

### Memorization / Recall Technique

With sufficient brain preparation and high quality learning material, I won't learning anything if I can't memorize properly. For starters, we'll need to imagine the structure of the English language (that we developed from [brain preparation](###Brains Preparation)).  Once we know how the concept we're about to learn fits in, we can start memorizing it. It's important that we used spaces repetition techniques to accomplish this. I'm not exactly sure I'll do this, but I'll have to think of something.

Usually languages are learned by first learning the present tense, the past tense, the future tense, etc. I think I might want to do it differently. Once I create a map of the kind of grammatical structures in English language, I'll learn whatever structures share the same verb tense. That way, I can learn something new while still periodically recalling the same verb sense. That may be variations of the present tense - but if there is no difference then it might be better to learn past tense. It could be that learning variations of (ex. present, past) tense is too difficult because the learner would have to understand the functionality of conjunctions etc. other stuff (which may be too complicated).
