Now, a bit unrelated (probably move to separate blog)
Because I tackled something so foreign (and specific) last summer (web dev) and got pretty "advanced", I was inspired to learn something totally foreign this summer. Something that would be extremely difficult to later in life. Naturally I realized learning a language fit this definition well. So I was thinking about learning German, Vietnamese, or Korean or something. The thing about learning a language is that it remaps quite a lot of your brain (which is why it can be so difficult at an older age when your brain is less fluid). And learning a third language is much easier than learning the second. By comparison, learning your 6th language may be a piece of cake. Would it be easier to learn two or even three extra languages at once - make it super painful at the beginning - but then make it easier to learn languages later on? If you don't do it correctly, it may completely wreck how your mind maps out the languages. So before I learn the aforementioned languages, I'll need to map out how English is structured and works - at a high level and at lower levels. This is one reason why learning the 5th language is easier than the 2nd - you already know the major components a language has and have that mapped out in your brain (consciously). If you're learning a second language and don't know what a language *is* or *consists of*, then it's going to be more difficult. How much more difficult? Hopefully considerably, because it would make my technique more effective.
