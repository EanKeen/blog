      <description>I decided to create a new blog. I&amp;rsquo;m mostly going to write about my programming projects and some programming topics. The objective of this blog is to increase my understanding of various programming topics, since explaining a topic will yield better conceptual understanding (of that topic).
This blog was created using Hugo, one of the fastest static-site generators. It has speed, wide-support, and great themes.
Overtime, I&amp;rsquo;ll style the blog to my liking and (hopefully) post many high-quality blogs.</description>
