      <description>Just recently, I added support to render LaTeX math equations with the rendering engine KaTeX for this blog. I chose it over MathJax because it performs substantially faster than MathJax. To integrate KaTeX in my Hugo blog, I had to use the Mmark Markdown processor rather than Hugo&#39;s default Blackfriday processor.
There are three steps to follow so you can write LaTeX in markdown for KaTeX to use.
 Create a KateX partial Integrate the KateX partial in your header or footer element Activate the KaTeX partial in the markdown file  Create a KaTex partial To get KaTex to work, you have to to import their JavaScript and CSS files.</description>

      <title>New Blog</title>

      <description>I decided to create a new blog. I&amp;rsquo;m mostly going to write about my programming projects and some programming topics. The objective of this blog is to increase my understanding of various programming topics, since explaining a topic will yield better conceptual understanding (of that topic).
This blog was created using Hugo, one of the fastest static-site generators. It has speed, wide-support, and great themes.
Overtime, I&amp;rsquo;ll style the blog to my liking and (hopefully) post many high-quality blogs.</description>
