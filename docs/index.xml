      <title>Making a Website for My Robotics Competition</title>

      <description>During the November of 2018, I became aware of a website competition. I had the opportunity to submit a website that showcased my robotics club by mid-January. Website creation tools (like ones from Wix or Weebly) were not prohibited. After learning this, I thought this competition would be perfect to apply the frontend skills that I recently learned! I knew I probably wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to win, but I wanted to give it my best shot.</description>

      <description>If you&#39;re not familiar with Pascal&#39;s Triangle, see part 1.
Finding a Formula  How do we leverage the relationship (in the image above) to obtain an equation that obtains the \(z\)th term (\(Fib(z)\), or \(F(z)\)) in the Fibonacci sequence? First, we need to figure out what our equation may look like. We know we&#39;re adding up terms of the Fibonacci sequence, so a summation symbol will be used. Additionally, we are adding up terms from Pascal&#39;s triangle, where each term individually can be written as \(_nC_r\).</description>

      <description>If you&#39;re familiar with the intricacies of Pascal&#39;s Triangle, see how I did it by going to part 2.
Background of Pascal&#39;s Triangle A while back, I was reintroduced to Pascal&#39;s Triangle by my pre-calculus teacher. Pascal&#39;s triangle can be written as an infintely expanding triangle, with each term being generated as the sum of the two numbers adjacently above it. For example, both \(10\)s in the triangle below are the sum of \(6\) and \(4\).</description>

      <title>Render LaTeX with KaTex in Hugo Blog</title>

      <description>Just recently, I added support to render LaTeX math equations with the rendering engine KaTeX for this blog. I chose it over MathJax because it performs substantially faster. To integrate KaTeX in my Hugo blog, I used the Mmark Markdown processor rather than Hugo&#39;s default Blackfriday processor.
There are three steps to follow so you can write LaTeX in markdown for KaTeX to use.
 Create a KateX partial Integrate the KateX partial in your header or footer element Activate the KaTeX partial in the markdown file  What is a partial?</description>

      <title>New Blog</title>
      <link>https://eankeen.github.io/blog/new-blog/</link>

      <description>I decided to create a new blog. I&amp;rsquo;m mostly going to write about my programming projects and some programming topics. The objective of this blog is to increase my understanding of various programming topics, since explaining a topic will yield better conceptual understanding (of that topic).
This blog was created using Hugo, one of the fastest static-site generators. It has speed, wide-support, and great themes.
Overtime, I&amp;rsquo;ll style the blog to my liking and (hopefully) post many high-quality blogs.</description>
